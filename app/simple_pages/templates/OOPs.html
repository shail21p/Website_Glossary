        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Instantiation:</strong> In programming, instantiation is the creation of a real instance or particular realization of an abstraction or template such as a class of objects or a computer process. To instantiate is to create such an instance by, for example, defining one particular variation of object within a class, giving it a name, and locating it in some physical place.<br><strong>Object: </strong>An object, in object-oriented programming (OOP), is an abstract data type created by a developer. It can include multiple properties and methods and may even contain other objects. In most programming languages, objects are defined as classes. <br><strong>Class:</strong> A class is used in object-oriented programming to describe one or more objects. It serves as a template for creating, or instantiating, specific objects within a program. While each object is created from a singleclass, one class can be used to instantiate multiple objects.<br><strong>Namespace:</strong> A namespace is a group of related elements that each have a unique name or identifier. There are several different types of namespaces, and each one has a specific syntax used to define the corresponding elements. Each element within a namespace has a &quot;local name&quot; that serves as a unique identifier. <br><strong>Constructor:</strong> A constructor is a special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type. Whenever an object is created, the constructor is called automatically.<br><strong>Fixture:</strong> For a simple API, setting up the Fixture may be as simple as creating a new instance of the SUT, and possibly any Expected or Anonymous Variables. On the other hand, for a complex API, setting up the fixture may require quite a bit of (potentially repetitive) code.<br><strong>Type-hint: </strong>This module provides runtime support for type hints. The most fundamental support consists of the types Any, Union, Callable, TypeVar, and Generic. Type-Cast: Type casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users.in this article, we will see the various technique for typecasting. <br><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> In computer programming,<strong> </strong>unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. Static: Static methods, much like class methods, are methods that are bound to a class rather than its object. They do not require a class instance creation. So, they are not dependent on the state of the object. Instance method: An <em>instance method</em> is a method that belongs to instances of a class, not to the class itself. To define an instance method, just omit static from the method heading.<br><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Encapsulation in Python is the process of wrapping up variables and methods into a single entity. In programming, a class is an example that wraps all the variables and methods defined inside it.<br><strong>Inheritance: </strong>Inheritance enables us to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows us to add more. In this tutorial, you will learn to use inheritance in Python.<br><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding the real implementation of an application from the user and emphasizing only on usage of it. <br><strong>Principlesof Solid:</strong> The SOLID principles are a fundamental set of concepts that ensure that Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is done correctly. SOLID was initially promoted as a set of related principles by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin" target="_blank">Robert C. Martin</a>, and since have become a standard in the field of software engineering. This article explains the five SOLID principles in practical terms with a few simple examples in C#. The SOLID principles of OOP are: Single ResponsibilityPrinciple, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP),Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP). The SOLID principles ensure that OOP applications are readable, testable, scalable, and maintainable.</p>
