        <h2 class="about-subheading">AAA Testing: The “Arrange-Act-Assert” (also AAA and 3A) pattern of testing was observed and named by Bill Wake in 2001.
The pattern focuses each test on a single action. The advantage of this focus is that it clearly separates the arrangement of the System Under Test (SUT) and the assertions that are made on it after the action.

          <p class="paragraph"><ul><li>First there is the test definition, docstring and Arrangement.</li>
          <li>In the middle, there is a single line of code - this is the most important part: The Act.</li>
          <li>Finally, there are the Assertions. You can see that the Assert block code lines all start with the orange / brown colour - that is because the Python keyword assert is marked with this colour in Vim with my current configuration.</li>
      </ul>
